This week he amplified articles and videos promoting another completely baseless theory about Obama.
On Tuesday, Trump retweeted a post from an account linked to QAnon, a collective of online conspiracists, which has since been suspended. The tweet alleged "Biden and Obama may have had Seal Team 6 killed," Osama Bin Laden was still alive, and that the man killed in the Obama-directed raid lead by Seal Team 6 was actually a body double. Later that night, Trump retweeted a post claiming top Obama administration officials colluded to bring bin Laden from Iran to Pakistan for "Obama''s trophy kill."
Facts First: Both of these theories are baseless and play into Trump''s trend of casting false aspersions on the legacy of his predecessor.
In the early morning hours of May 2, 2011, Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US Special Forces during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A DNA test was conducted, confirming it was bin Laden. He was buried at sea.
Those are the facts.
Trump''s initial retweet was rebuked by one of the Navy SEAL members of the raid, who is very much still alive. "Very brave men said goodby (sic) to their kids to go kill Osama bin Laden," Robert J. O''Neill tweeted following Trump''s retweet. "We were given the order by President Obama. It was not a body double."

Coordination on when Biden will receive his first briefing is currently underway, but the move is another step toward a transition of power that President Donald Trump held up for weeks after it was clear he lost the 2020 election.
It follows a formal notice by the General Services Administration Monday night that the formal transition of government can proceed.
Receiving a classified intelligence briefing is typically one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election. It contains information about pressing national security issues that the new president will soon face. But Biden has yet to receive an intelligence briefing because of Trump''s effort to overturn the results of the election, which cause confusion inside the federal government over whether a transition could begin.
The PDB, as it''s known, is prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for the President, vice president and senior advisers.
An ODNI official attributed the change directly to the White House''s move to formally grant Biden access to the PDB. CNN previously reported the decision was Trump''s and the access to the PDB could have been granted before the GSA administrator made the transition official Monday.
ODNI, which is overseen by Trump''s handpicked intelligence chief John Ratcliffe, previously referred all questions about Biden and the PDB back to the White House, underscoring the fact that the decision regarding Biden''s access to the nation''s most highly classified secrets rested with Trump.
"Following the statutory direction of the Presidential Transition Act, ODNI will provide requested support to the transition team," an ODNI spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday. "This afternoon the White House approved ODNI to move forward with providing the PDB as part of the support to the transition."
A Biden transition official told CNN they had no comment on the decision to give the President-elect a classified briefing. Biden declined to answer a shouted question on the status of the briefings as he introduced his top national security picks Tuesday.
The ODNI official said this transition period could include providing an overview of the agency and related operations in addition to supporting the delivery of intelligence briefings.
The PDB is often tailored to the President currently in office. President George W. Bush preferred being briefed orally by his top intelligence aides while President Barack Obama often read through his on a secure tablet. Trump often received his in late-morning sessions with career intelligence officials, though at times it disappeared from his schedule altogether.
For the last three weeks, Trump has sought to overturn the results of an election that his own administration described as the most secure in US history, before he fired the official who made that statement. In recent days, more Republicans had come forward to urge Trump to allow Biden to receive classified intelligence briefings, including his longtime ally South Carolina Sen.

Trump has frequently flouted public health warnings and hosted large groups at the White House for events that have later been deemed superspreaders, including a ceremony for new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, after which the President tested positive for coronavirus.

Members who were suddenly removed include former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, former ranking member of the House Intelligence committee Jane Harman and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, two of the officials said.
The Defense Policy Board is an outside advisory group of former high profile national security officials who "provide the Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, independent, informed advice and opinions concerning matters of defense policy in response to specific tasks from the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense," according to their website.

We are extremely grateful for their dedicated service, commitment, and contributions to our national security. Future announcements for new members of the board will be made soon," the third official said.

"As we adapt the Department for great power competition, I look forward to naming new board members in the coming days," Miller said.

At both agencies, Biden is considering contenders with deep experience in their fields and a track record in Washington -- but some of his candidates are also spurring dissent from corners of the Democratic Party that could make the President-elect''s choices a more complicated matter.
For weeks, observers have speculated that Biden would entrust the Department of Defense to the veteran Pentagon official Michèle Flournoy, the most seasoned defense expert among the names being floated, though she has been opposed by progressives.
After Biden named another woman, Avril Haines, to be his Director of National Intelligence on Tuesday, attention turned to who will lead the Central Intelligence Agency. There''s no discussion of keeping the current director, Gina Haspel, who has had a fraught relationship with President Donald Trump and is expected to resign on Inauguration Day, if she isn''t fired before then. But one of Biden''s reported candidates to replace her has already been denounced as a "torture apologist."
Options
A decision on the nominee for Secretary of Defense is expected to be made in early December and as soon as early next week, transition advisers say, with at least two other potential candidates still in contention besides Flournoy.
Transition advisers say options presented to Biden include Jeh Johnson, the former secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration. Some former officials close to the selection process believe Johnson is also in contention for the position of Attorney General, underscoring the notion that the Biden team is still trying to fit various contenders into the Cabinet puzzle.
Another name being floated to lead the defense department: Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and a decorated veteran who was wounded in combat.
Two transition advisers cautioned against reading anything into the fact that Flournoy was not included in the national security team announced this week in Wilmington.
But it was also not immediately clear why she was not on stage with the nominees for Secretary of State, Director of National Intelligence and Homeland Security Secretary, given that she has been a well-known quantity, a leader in the defense field for years and has been widely seen as a leading candidate to lead Biden''s Pentagon.
One transition adviser told CNN that Cabinet members should be viewed as pieces of a larger puzzle, rather than simply a series of individual decisions. And Biden and his team were taking additional time piecing together other selections before announcing his Defense Secretary pick.
A transition adviser said Flournoy''s well known differences with Biden over the years on Iraq and Afghanistan policy were not a factor in the decision making process, pointing to the President-elect''s admonition on Tuesday.
"They''ll tell me what I need to know, not what I want to know -- what I need to know," Biden said, flanked by the first wave of Cabinet nominees.
If Flournoy is the nominee, she is expected to prioritize spending on future technologies and restoring the civilian-military balance in the Pentagon to ensure the most critical decisions and policy discussions are under the control of civilian officials.
Her case for the job received a boost on Wednesday from two Democratic subcommittee chairs on the House Armed Services Committee.
"Flournoy would be the first woman nominated to be Secretary of Defense. As the Department struggles with toxic workplace culture even as it opens special operations and the combat arms to women, breaking this glass ceiling is long overdue," the statement from Chairwoman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, Jackie Speier, and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Jim Langevin said.

On Monday, the GSA informed President-elect Joe Biden that the Trump administration is ready to begin the formal transition process, according to a letter from Administrator Emily Murphy, marking the first step the Trump administration has taken to acknowledge President Donald Trump''s defeat -- more than two weeks after Biden was declared the winner in the election.
The Biden team was not able to access funding or participate in transition talks with government personnel until the GSA initiated the process, which raised concerns about the transition, especially as the Biden team prepares to take over the response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and distribution of a vaccine.
The senior CDC official told CNN that they expect there will be some "rebuilding of the agency" under Biden, though that is standard operating procedure in any transition of administrations.
When asked if there was more enthusiasm among senior leaders at the CDC on Tuesday morning due to the start of the transition, the official said emphatically, "Yes!"
A federal health official declined to say if they had spoken directly to anyone from the Biden transition team as of Tuesday morning. But having been through numerous administration transitions, "the CDC benefits when that happens quickly," the official said.
"From experience, the faster you get through it the better," the official said of the transition.
The official said there did seem to be more enthusiasm that the CDC may be able to restart regular briefings, which were ordered to be stopped by the Trump administration at the beginning of the pandemic.

Over the next four years, as the Trump administration sought to damage American democracy, it also propagated an ideal of manhood hostile to women''s rights. This misogyny is in line with a century of authoritarian history.
Women who seek equal opportunities, equal pay and reproductive rights, have always been the strongman''s adversaries, no less than prosecutors, journalists, and the political opposition. The start of the Joe Biden presidency in January 2021, with Sen. Kamala Harris in the role of the first female vice president, offers an opportunity to start to repair the damage.
The Biden-Harris administration''s first tasks will be to tame the raging pandemic and mitigate its effects on the economy so that a nation exhausted by illness, loss of loved ones, and increased caregiving responsibilities can start to heal. Yet four years of having a brutal misogynist in the White House also shows the urgency of addressing structural racial and gender inequities in society and tracing a path that encourages rather than punishes female autonomy and power.
In democracies, strongman leaders on the rise typically find favor after periods of progress on issues of gender, racial, and class equity, when anxieties about (White) male authority and status are at a peak. Trump was no exception. During President Barack Obama''s two terms in office, for example, the US military committed to implementing full gender integration in 2013, same-sex marriage became legal in all 50 states in 2015, and a new Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Select Task Force began to study workplace harassment in 2016. As of June 30, 2016, transgender individuals were allowed to serve in the US military -- a measure reversed by the Trump administration in January 2018.
By then the misogynist speech and attitudes Trump had used to distinguish himself from other candidates during his 2015-2016 campaign (most notably by treating his opponent, Hillary Clinton, as a "nasty" woman who deserved to be "locked up") had become part of his presidential brand.
Like other illiberal leaders who use hypermasculinity as a tool of political legitimation (Russia''s Vladimir Putin, who often posed shirtless in his younger years, comes to mind). Trump''s appeal has always been tied to his embodiment of an ethos of macho lawlessness. "When you''re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything," boasted Trump (about groping women) in 2005 to Billy Bush, the producer of "Access Hollywood." This infamous conversation, made public in 2016, channels the approach to governance and life of every authoritarian-minded leader, who earns the admiration of men and some women by getting away with what lesser men cannot.
The Trump administration also made it easier for men to act on their desires with impunity. In 2019, the Department of Justice''s Office of Violence Against Women changed the definition of domestic violence on its website. The definition no longer specifies "sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person," as "felony or misdemeanor crimes," only physical acts of harm. In 2020, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos revised Title IX regulations to give accused sexual harassers and assaulters the right to cross-examine their victims through a lawyer or other representative during live hearings. Trump''s defense of men like former Fox host Bill O''Reilly and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault (allegations they also deny) fits this pattern as well.
Given this history, the number of White women who voted for Trump in 2020 as in 2016, may seem puzzling. Yet today''s illiberal leaders often enjoy popularity among women. Some grant maternal assistance and other social welfare benefits (like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán) and women of the "right" skin color, sexual orientation and religion certainly fare better than women and men of marginalized groups who are often the target of the strongman''s autocratic rhetoric and policies. Trump has appointed women to positions of authority, like DeVos. The modern strongman can tolerate powerful women as long as they work for him -- and don''t challenge him in public.
Trump''s success at building a personality cult, which earned him over 70 million votes despite his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic, is a testament to the enduring appeal for many of the cult of male force and male superiority over women. Arguably no sector of American government was more bullied by Trump than the US intelligence community and he asserted his isolationism in the most vicious terms. Already, Biden has taken healing steps on both fronts by nominating Avril Haines to be his national intelligence director and Linda Thomas-Greenfield as his ambassador to the United Nations. By naming these women first, and choosing qualified candidates who are anything but sycophants, President-elect Biden has begun to unravel the knot of autocratic misogyny left by his predecessor.

Just as he began his long march to the White House by touting the racist "birther theory" that Barack Obama was not an American citizen, Trump and his allies are choregraphing his slow walk away from the Oval Office to a backbeat of accusations that the election was stolen from him in heavily African American cities such as Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Atlanta.
These charges of urban voting fraud -- the distant bookend to his birther slanders -- underscore how much Trump''s political message revolves around convincing his coalition that an insidious combination of disdainful elites and dangerous minorities is unfairly taking away "our country," as he often calls America.
CNN complete election results
"This is in the continuum of the conversation about people losing their country," says Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster. "When talking about the election being stolen from them, what they are really saying is, again, those people are taking our country. When they say, ''Let''s disqualify the votes in Milwaukee ... the votes in Philadelphia ... in Atlanta and Detroit,'' they are all but saying it: The votes of ''those people'' should not count."
That Trump and his allies would return to this imagery so quickly after an election in which he made modest but meaningful gains with Black voters, and even larger advances with Hispanics in some areas, shows how difficult it will be for the GOP to disentangle itself from the President''s racist messaging and expand beyond those beachheads in the minority community to truly build the "multiracial working class" coalition that some GOP thinkers yearn for.
"If you look at Blacks ideologically, politically, it''s a stereotype that they are ultraliberal," says Katherine Tate, a Brown University political scientist who studies Black voting behavior. "Higher percentages of them should have been voting Republican a while ago."
Had Republicans nominated another candidate, she says, who avoided Trump''s open appeals to racial resentments but offered "the same political agenda, securing the border, skepticism about Covid, withdraw troops from overseas wars and ban immigration as best you can ... that candidate would have done better [with Black voters] than Donald Trump."
The focus by Trump and his allies on alleged fraud in heavily minority central cities is especially striking both because the President actually improved on his vote in some of them compared with 2016 and also because he suffered greater losses in well-educated and often mostly White suburban areas, where Republicans have not made similar accusations.
"He can''t ever acknowledge or admit that White people let him down, so he has nowhere else to go," Michael Nutter, the former Philadelphia mayor, told me.
The disparity is especially jarring in Pennsylvania, where Trump, as of the current count, lost Philadelphia by about the same margin as he did in 2016 but Biden won the big surrounding white-collar suburban counties of Montgomery and Delaware by an unprecedented 215,000 votes, almost 50% more than Hillary Clinton did last time. But at a feverish fact-free news conference of Trump attorneys last week, Rudy Giuliani singled out Philadelphia -- along with Detroit -- for especially vitriolic accusations.
"The only surprise I would have found in this is if Philadelphia hadn''t cheated in this election, because for the last 60 years they''ve cheated in just about every single election," he charged. "You could say the same thing about Detroit."
To which Nutter, now a professor of practice at Columbia University''s School of International and Public Affairs, responds: "What they are saying is everything but that Black people stole it, and playing into just the worst of the worst stereotypes. What Giuliani said the other day, that Philly has been corrupt for the last 60 years: What ... are you talking about? Based on what? These are the worst of their racist tendencies. ... "
Trump likely drew more Black support in 2020
No aspect of the election results has caused more head-scratching among Democrats than the evidence that Trump, despite the kinds of appeals to White racial resentment infusing his fraud accusations, clearly appeared to improve on his 2016 vote share among African Americans (as well as Hispanics, especially in Florida and Texas).
Precise comparisons are difficult because the various data sources that measure the electorate''s preferences don''t exactly agree on how Trump performed this time -- or his showing last time. But the overall trajectory is consistent. In three major sources of estimates of the 2016 vote, Trump lost African American voters by margins ranging from 81 percentage points (according to the exit polls conducted for a consortium of media organizations including CNN) to 85 points (according to the "validated voters" study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center) to 89 points (in the University of Michigan''s American National Election Studies.)
This time, estimates of Trump''s deficit with Black voters ranged from 82 percentage points (in the VoteCast survey conducted by The Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center), 79 points (in an Election Day survey by the GOP firm Public Opinion Strategies) and 75 points in the 2020 exit polls. Both the VoteCast and exit poll studies found that Trump ran about twice as well with Black men as Black women, but both polls recorded gains for him with each group when compared with the major data sources from 2016.
Perceptions of how Trump performed among Black voters may change somewhat when other studies are completed that rely on analyzing the actual voter files (including Pew''s "validated voter" research and work by Catalist, a Democratic voter-targeting firm.) But the results so far are already spurring heated debate among Democrats.
Some party strategists have raised alarms over the evidence that Trump improved on his showing from 2016 and has established a particular beachhead among Black men as well as some younger Black voters.
Terrance Woodbury, a Democratic consultant, said Trump''s showing with both groups represented a "red flag" for the party. While a certain share of Black voters will always vote Republican, he says that in focus groups he conducted throughout the campaign, Trump was widening his support to a circle of African Americans who didn''t necessarily agree with his ideology but were open to him because they believed both parties had failed them.
"This is the red flag for me: It is the young Black man who said to me, ''My ''hood didn''t get any better under [Barack] Obama, it didn''t get any worse under Trump, so what''s the difference?'' " Woodbury told me. Likewise, he said, even some Black voters who considered Trump a racist did not view that as disqualifying because they thought that White Democratic politicians were racist as well, even if they tried better to hide it.
"They say things like ''They are all racist, but at least I know where this one is coming from,'' " he says.
Yet even Trump''s success in improving his share of the vote among Blacks compared with 2016 carried him only back to the typical deficits faced by GOP nominees before Obama''s first run in 2008. From 1984 through 2004, every GOP presidential nominee lost Black voters by margins ranging from 72 to 81 percentage points, according to the exit polls -- roughly where the major data sources put Trump''s shortfall this year.
Belcher, the Democratic pollster, also points out that Trump''s improved share of the Black vote compared with 2016 is only half of the 2020 story. The other half is that by all indications many more African Americans voted in 2020 than in 2016. That turnout increase means that even as Trump enlarged his share of the Black vote, he almost certainly faced a much larger absolute deficit among them in 2020 than in 2016.', '2020-11-23 16:13:23');

Biden has promised swift change, but it won''t be simple.
"They''re realizing that they have two months to figure out a really complicated mess of things," a source familiar with the transition told CNN, referring to the Biden team. "People are really overwhelmed trying to figure out the sheer issues, the sheer number of pieces you have to coordinate. This is the genius of Stephen Miller."
Miller, President Donald Trump''s lead immigration adviser and the architect of his hard-line immigration agenda, has shepherded some of the most restrictionist immigration policies -- and continues to do so -- with the intent of curtailing immigration to the US. The hundreds of executive actions rolled out by the Trump administration have drawn the ire of immigrant advocates and lawmakers, who argue they''ve betrayed the country''s welcoming stance.
The makeup of the Biden-Harris transition team reviewing the Department of Homeland Security appears to signal the incoming administration''s awareness of those actions, with Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, as the team lead, and with the selection of Alejandro Mayorkas as Homeland Security secretary. But undoing policies -- as Biden has said he''d do -- will be a steep challenge, both logistically and politically.
"They''re coming into the office with a mandate and an intent -- in many ways needed and appropriate -- to reverse Trump-era immigration policies," a former Homeland Security official told CNN.
Even changes that are ultimately up to the president could face hurdles, including Biden''s pledge to bring more refugees to the United States. Biden has said he wants to raise the cap to 125,000 -- an increase from the historic low of 15,000 put in place by the Trump administration.
But a change in actual arrivals would require policy changes and new refugee interviews, according to a source familiar with the process. The diversion of refugee officers to work on asylum cases the past two years has also left the pipeline largely void of refugees who are advanced in the system, the source said. There are also challenges that arise with Covid-19, including US Citizenship and Immigration Services interview teams being unable to travel.
Other pledges by the Biden administration include repealing regulations that have made seeking asylum in the US exceedingly difficult -- a process that could take months. But in the near future, the most urgent challenge for a Biden administration might be how to execute those promises, while acknowledging the potential for a spike in migrants at the US-Mexico border.
The Trump administration implemented two major policies on the US-Mexico border that were unprecedented -- the so-called "remain in Mexico" policy, which returned non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico until their immigration court date in the United States, and a public health order, related to coronavirus, that allows for the swift removal of migrants arrested at the border.
Each of those policies has made claiming asylum in the US at the southern border nearly impossible, but the consequence of pulling them back too quickly could result in a sudden increase of migrants on the southern border.
"You don''t want a surge to happen before you''re ready to handle it," said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. "They''re going to have to rely on one of the policies they hate the most and that they disagree with philosophically, so that they can get to a long term fix."
The former DHS official echoed that concern: "You have to have a pressure valve in place before you start unwinding down these policies or you''ll allow a crisis to generate."', '2020-11-29 12:22:32');

Coordination on when Biden will receive his first briefing is currently underway, but the move is another step toward a transition of power that President Donald Trump held up for weeks after it was clear he lost the 2020 election.
It follows a formal notice by the General Services Administration Monday night that the formal transition of government can proceed.
Receiving a classified intelligence briefing is typically one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election. It contains information about pressing national security issues that the new president will soon face. But Biden has yet to receive an intelligence briefing because of Trump''s effort to overturn the results of the election, which cause confusion inside the federal government over whether a transition could begin.
The PDB, as it''s known, is prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for the President, vice president and senior advisers.
An ODNI official attributed the change directly to the White House''s move to formally grant Biden access to the PDB. CNN previously reported the decision was Trump''s and the access to the PDB could have been granted before the GSA administrator made the transition official Monday.
ODNI, which is overseen by Trump''s handpicked intelligence chief John Ratcliffe, previously referred all questions about Biden and the PDB back to the White House, underscoring the fact that the decision regarding Biden''s access to the nation''s most highly classified secrets rested with Trump.
"Following the statutory direction of the Presidential Transition Act, ODNI will provide requested support to the transition team," an ODNI spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday. "This afternoon the White House approved ODNI to move forward with providing the PDB as part of the support to the transition."
A Biden transition official told CNN they had no comment on the decision to give the President-elect a classified briefing. Biden declined to answer a shouted question on the status of the briefings as he introduced his top national security picks Tuesday.
The ODNI official said this transition period could include providing an overview of the agency and related operations in addition to supporting the delivery of intelligence briefings.
The PDB is often tailored to the President currently in office. President George W. Bush preferred being briefed orally by his top intelligence aides while President Barack Obama often read through his on a secure tablet. Trump often received his in late-morning sessions with career intelligence officials, though at times it disappeared from his schedule altogether.
For the last three weeks, Trump has sought to overturn the results of an election that his own administration described as the most secure in US history, before he fired the official who made that statement. In recent days, more Republicans had come forward to urge Trump to allow Biden to receive classified intelligence briefings, including his longtime ally South Carolina Sen.

If neither push the deadline back, millions of student loan payments will come due a couple of weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20. Even if Biden reinstates the pause retroactively, it could create confusion for borrowers as well as a mess for student loan processors who aren''t built to suddenly stop or start payments -- all while the economic recovery slows and Covid-19 cases surge.
And either way, Biden will be left with a choice: Keep Trump''s policy in place, or go bigger and cancel debt altogether, a step some Democrats argue Biden can take without Congress.
Biden on Monday sidestepped a question about whether he would use executive power to forgive student debt. Instead, he expressed support for the House Democrats'' stimulus package, which would extend the suspension of payments through September 2021 and cancel some student debt.
"Legislation from the Democratic House calls for an immediate $10,000 forgiveness of student loans," Biden said.
"It''s holding people up. They''re in real trouble. They''re having to make choices between paying their student loan and paying the rent, those kinds of decisions. It should be done immediately," he added.
Trump originally waived interest on student loans in March, as large parts of the economy began to shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
A broader version of student loan relief was included in the $2 trillion economic stimulus package signed into law two weeks later. Under the program, the US government automatically suspended payments and waived interest on federal student loans through September. Trump later moved the expiration date to the end of the year by executive order.
The suspension and interest waiver applied only to federally held loans, which covered roughly 85% of federal student loans. That included loans known as Direct federal loans, as well as PLUS loans that parents may have taken out on behalf of their children.
It excluded some federal loans that are guaranteed by the government by not technically held by it. Generally, those were disbursed prior to 2010.
The emergency moves came after years of debate among Democrats over how to ease Americans'' gigantic student loan debt.
Yet, unlike more progressive Democrats, Biden did not initially include student debt cancellation in his campaign platform. But he eventually embraced a plan to forgive $10,000 per borrower to help families during the pandemic as part of a July report released by a joint task force with Sen. Bernie Sanders, his longest lasting opponent in the Democratic primary election.
Progressive Democrats already appear ready to pressure Biden to uphold this pledge, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who''s urging Biden to "cancel billions of dollars in student loan debt" on day one. Warren, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, called on Trump in September to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower.
Warren argues that the secretary of education has the authority to broadly cancel federal student loans, a claim backed up in a memo from lawyers at Harvard''s Legal Services Center and its Project on Predatory Student Lending.
But Biden may be reluctant to wipe away debt unilaterally and prefer it come from Congress -- which will remain divided unless Democrats sweep two runoff Senate elections in Georgia on January 5.
"The Secretary does have some power to cancel student debt. But there is both a legal and a practical question of how far the administration can go," said Robert Shireman, who served in the Obama administration as deputy undersecretary of education and is currently a senior fellow at The Century Foundation.
What is more clear is that the secretary of education can cancel student debt for borrowers who were defrauded by their colleges.
This has been happening for years, though Secretary Betsy DeVos has rolled back Obama-era rules that made the process easier for those students to seek relief.
There are thousands of borrowers who say they were defrauded by now-defunct for-profit colleges like Corinthian and ITT Tech and have been waiting for years for the Education Department to process their claims.
The National Student Legal Defense Network, founded by former Education Department officials, is urging Biden to use executive authority on day one to cancel the student debt for defrauded students and those whose colleges have closed, as well as the debt of permanently disabled individuals. That could provide relief for hundreds of thousands of borrowers.', '2020-11-17 12:27:25');

For instance, the Department of Homeland Security is trying to ramp up agreements to send asylum seekers to Central American countries, plans that have largely been under the radar during the coronavirus pandemic, according to three sources familiar with the discussions, as well as rules regarding student visas and work permits.
The push is in line with a years-long effort to usher forward a slew of policy changes that have overhauled the US immigration system -- and in part, a concession that a new administration is incoming.
"It''s the same thing that happens in the twilight of every administration -- you want to finish what you started and give it as much staying power as you possibly can," said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates reduced immigration.
Donald Trump''s presidency offered an opportunity to tighten immigration rules and curtail the flow of migration to the United States. Behind that push is Stephen Miller, Trump''s lead immigration adviser and the architect of his hard-line immigration agenda. Immigrant advocates have slammed Miller and the administration for their actions, arguing that the changes have betrayed the country''s posture of welcoming immigrants.
Over the last four years, administration officials, some of whom hailed from groups advocating reduced immigration, have leaned on immigration opponents to discuss policy changes. That continues to be the case now, with more urgency.
"There''s always going to be a higher level of intensity when time is limited," said Chris Chmielenski, deputy director at NumbersUSA. "There has been constant communication between us and administration officials on what we still want done."
Vaughan said she''s been in touch with administration officials who are trying to identify any final items that can be finalized before President-elect Joe Biden comes into office.
"People are looking for stuff to do. People are asking, is there anything you think we could make progress on, anything you think needs to be fixed," Vaughan said. "It''s nothing that''s going to make a difference within two months. People want to know if there are policy changes that can be made, but I think the general view is there is not a lot that can be done."
It''s common for administrations to try to get pending items across the finish line before a transfer of power, but such moves have the potential of setting up more hurdles for Biden, who''s pledged to roll back Trump immigration policies, many of which have occurred through regulations that can be more arduous to reverse.
In interviews, advocates of reduced immigration -- who rallied behind policies and regulatory changes in recent years that drastically limited migration to the US -- generally agreed that the administration has succeeded in most of what it set out to accomplish.

Trump was making what is likely to be his final appearance at an international summit after losing the US presidential election to Joe Biden. His views on the climate crisis -- along with a host of other issues, from trade to security -- have caused deep fissures in traditional US alliances that President-elect Biden has promised to repair.
Trump''s speech on the environment, which was pre-taped from the White House, provided an apt end to his four years of disagreements on the issue with fellow world leaders. In it, Trump called the 2015 Paris agreement "one-sided" and claimed it was designed to inflict ruin on the US economy.
"The Paris accord was not designed to save the environment, it was designed to kill the American economy," he said, speaking from the Diplomatic Room. "I refuse to surrender millions of American jobs and send trillions of American dollars to the world''s worst polluters and environmental offenders, and that''s what would have happened."
Trump announced the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement in the first year of his presidency, resisting some internal pushback among his advisers who worried it would cause tensions with European and Asian allies.
The process of pulling out wasn''t finalized until this month, however, and Biden has said he will reenter the pact after he is sworn in. Trump''s pending departure has brought his influence on the global stage to its lowest ebb. Most of the other G20 leaders have congratulated Biden on his victory.
Trump''s participation in this year''s G20 wasn''t even certain until late Friday, when it appeared on his official schedule. Trump has made no secret of his distaste for large multilateral summits, questioning their value in conversations with aides.
On Saturday, Trump beamed into the opening session of the virtual summit from the White House Situation Room starting at 8 a.m. ET, though he began tweeting about his unfounded claims of election fraud 13 minutes later.
He delivered remarks during the opening session, but they weren''t made public by the summit organizers and the White House did not provide a copy of them. Later Saturday, Trump was at his golf course when a side-session on global pandemic preparedness was convened that featured speeches from French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor
The environmental video was played as part of a similar session on the margins of the G20, which is being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump''s comments were far afield from other leaders'' messages during the session, which focused on multilateral efforts to reduce carbon emissions in a bid to slow climate change.
Trump chose to focus instead on his conservation record in the United States, saying under his administration "environmental stewardship is a sacred obligation."
He said he''d worked to prevent children from being exposed to lead in drinking water, touted a pledge to plant 1 billion new trees and said he''d done more than any president for US national parks since Teddy Roosevelt.
But Trump also heralded his efforts to expand American fossil fuels, despite their role in fueling climate change.
"The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world," he said, citing horizontal drilling and fracking.
"Every day we are proving we can protect our workers, create new jobs and safeguard the environment without imposing crippling mandates and one-sided international agreements on our citizens," he said.', '2020-11-22 12:32:43');

This one will be done by machine and is even less likely to reverse his fate. Hours earlier, a federal judge rejected the Trump campaign''s latest effort to disenfranchise millions of voters -- this time in Pennsylvania.
All around the country, Trump lawyers and loyalists are seeing their baseless allegations of systemic voter fraud treated with increasing contempt by disbelieving judges.

The returns, though, seem to be diminishing and Joe Biden''s transition team is plowing forward -- with the President-elect set to announce his Cabinet picks this week.
On Saturday, it was Judge Matthew Brann, a Republican, who in tossing out a Trump-backed lawsuit felt compelled to underscore, with a literary flourish, the absurdity of the campaign''s assertions.
RELATED: CNN''s live results from the presidential election
"This claim, like Frankenstein''s Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together from two distinct theories in an attempt to avoid controlling precedent," Brann wrote. His decision prompted another Republican, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey -- who is not running for reelection in 2022 -- to do the bare minimum in breaking ranks with party leaders and acknowledging Biden as the President-elect.
Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch Trump ally, called the conduct of the President''s legal team a "national embarrassment" on Sunday and said it was time for him to end his futile legal gambit.
"I have been a supporter of the President''s. I voted for him twice, but elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn''t happen," Christie, an ABC contributor, said on "This Week."
Later Sunday, Trump''s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis attempted to distance themselves from attorney Sidney Powell, a member of Trump''s legal team who has been spreading conspiracy theories about the election and whom Christie had singled out.
"Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own," Giuliani and Ellis said in their statement, which came just days after Powell joined them for a wild news conference at Republican National Committee headquarters and a week after the President announced on Twitter that she was joining his legal team.
In her own statement later Sunday, Powell said she agreed that she was "not part of the campaign''s legal team" and that she never billed the campaign any fees. "My intent has always been to expose all the fraud I could find and let the chips fall where they may--whether it be upon Republicans or Democrats," she added, vowing to file an "epic" lawsuit this week.
But even as Trump''s brazen bid to subvert American democracy keeps gobbling up headlines, it is his appalling handling of the pandemic that seems poised now to etch itself more lastingly into the history books.
The United States surpassed 12 million coronavirus cases on Saturday, adding nearly 200,000 more to its staggering count. Trump has made no mention of the terrifying milestone. Rather, he spent part of the day golfing.
It was just as well.
Trump''s petulance worsens pandemic pain
When the lame duck President speaks about the pandemic, he only further undermines scattershot efforts to contain it. That Trump skipped out of a side-session focused on pandemic preparedness with world leaders at the G20 virtual gathering on Saturday surprised no one. It''s unlikely he was missed. All the while, states and cities around this country reported record-high numbers of infections as hospitalizations mounted -- setting off alarm bells over a collapse of an overwhelmed health care system. And that''s before millions of Americans begin their ill-advised holiday travels ahead of Thanksgiving this week.
More than 255,000 are already dead, millions out work, and the administration and its Republican allies in the Senate seem determined to deepen the despair -- while, in the process, undermining Biden''s efforts to right the ship when he takes control on January 20 of next year. By blocking Biden''s team from accessing sensitive government information, complicated operations like the distribution of a vaccine are likely to be delayed or made more cumbersome.
Moncef Slaoui, the head of the White House''s coronavirus vaccine effort, lamented Sunday that "it''s very unfortunate that the whole (vaccine) process has been politicized and, therefore, the context has created conditions whereby people''s perception has been exacerbated and we are where we are today."
Vaccines are safe for Americans, Slaoui told CNN''s Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," and with two separate vaccine makers -- Moderna and Pfizer -- reporting their vaccines are about 95% effective with no major safety concerns, "it''s almost a full insurance against this pandemic," he said.
Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed, told Tapper that the operation has stayed out of the political arena, but, when asked about the transition between the Trump administration and incoming Biden administration, said: "Smoothness is what we all aim for and therefore it would be better."
Some nine months after the coronavirus first gripped the country, there is still no unified plan to combat it. And measures taken by Congress to mitigate the pain are lapsing. The expanded federal unemployment benefits extended as part of $2 trillion package passed earlier this year are due to run out just after Christmas, affecting an estimated 12 million Americans. There is, for now, little to suggest a coming renaissance of negotiation on Capitol Hill, where Senate Republicans have refused to take up a new aid package passed by House Democrats and Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected potential piecemeal deals floated by the GOP in the run-up to the election.
The trickle down effects of inaction in Washington, DC, are being felt most acutely at the state and local level, where even officials who acknowledge the extent of the crisis are hesitant to take bold action and implement the kind of drastic measures proven to help curb the spread of the virus.
"You shut nonessential workplaces or indoor dining, you''re basically putting a bullet in them," New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on Friday about the absence of federal aid, suggesting that something like a "two-week pause" is effectively out of the question without a capital boost from Capitol Hill.
Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, ripped Senate Republicans over their hesitance to act -- a contrast with the body''s relatively swift passage of the initial $2 trillion package back in March.
"With more than 12 million cases, over a quarter million Americans dead, more than 60 million unemployment claims filed since March, 8 million people have been pushed into poverty, and over one hundred thousand businesses shuttered, the same exact Senate has recessed without even the notion of hope of relief for Americans destined to die more likely from homelessness than a raging pandemic," Nelson said. "Anyone musing politics makes inaction explainable better just resign now and let the patriotic essential workers take the reins."
Even within congressional ranks, the number of Covid cases is steadily rising. Just this week, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Rick Scott of Florida tested positive. On Saturday night, Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican campaigning ahead of a runoff for her seat, announced that she, too, returned a positive test, bringing the total count to more than three dozen lawmakers from both parties. (Loeffler''s campaign said Sunday that a previously inconclusive test came back negative but she will continue to undergo testing and self-isolate.)
The twin crises of Covid and Trump''s antidemocratic machinations collided over the last 48 hours, when two leading Michigan GOP lawmakers emerged from a meeting at the White House by stating, again, that they had seen no evidence to suggest Biden did not win their state fair and square. Instead, state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield apparently used at least part of their time with the President to deliver a letter pleading for more federal aid to fight the virus.
"Months ago, Michigan received funds through the federal CARES Act, and we used that funding to quickly support front line workers, improve testing, ensure adequate PPE, provide additional support to out-of-work Michiganders, and deliver assistance to local businesses that are struggling through no fault of their own," the Michigan Republicans said in a joint statement. "We once again face a time in our state when additional support would go a long way to help those same residents who need our help."
Trump retweeted the statement on Saturday morning, but ignored the request for help and focused on pumping air into his deflating campaign to upend the election.
"This is true, but much different than reported by the media," Trump said. "We will show massive and unprecedented fraud!"
The meeting drew criticism from Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who told Tapper on Sunday that it was "completely outrageous." Hogan, a moderate member of his party and a known Trump critic, also said he''s "embarrassed that more people in the party aren''t speaking up."
"We used to go supervise elections around the world, and we were the most respected, you know, country with respect to elections. And now we''re beginning to look like we''re a banana republic. It''s time for them to stop the nonsense," he said.
With a handful of local and state certification deadlines early next week, it has become plain that -- like with so many other promises -- Trump''s pledge to reveal some kind of massive, coordinated fraud will never materialize.
Shortly before news of the Pennsylvania case''s embarrassing defeat began to spread, Trump retreated to more hospitable territory -- the Wild West of social media -- to engage in a round of coronavirus whataboutism. He pointed to the toll of the pandemic on other countries and attacked the media for not reporting on the efficacy of emerging therapeutics.
"The Fake News is not talking about the fact that ''Covid'' is running wild all over the World, not just in the U.S.," he wrote, before referencing, presumably, the portion of the morning''s international summit he took part in. "I was at the Virtual G-20 meeting early this morning and the biggest subject was Covid. We will be healing fast, especially with our vaccines!"
Those vaccines, though promising, are still months away being made available to millions of desperate Americans, tens of thousands of whom are projected to die before they arrive.
Trump allies out to undermine Biden
In the meantime, Trump''s Treasury secretary appears to be doing his best to starve the distressed business community of a key lifeline. On Thursday, Steve Mnuchin requested that the Federal Reserve return some $455 billion in so-far unused funding that the central bank insists has -- and will -- continue to be crucial in preventing further economic woes.
Mnuchin himself, in a letter to the Federal Reserve, acknowledged that the lending programs "clearly achieved their objective." But he still demanded the return of the nearly half-trillion dollars, a move that brought objections from corporate leaders -- hardly a hotbed of anti-Trump resistance -- and the Fed, which said it preferred "that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy."
The reasoning for the decision, some experts said, appeared to be a bid to hamstring the incoming administration.
"This appears to be a political move by Team Trump to limit what President-elect Joe Biden can do next year to boost the economy," Jaret Seiberg, financial services and housing policy analyst for Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a research note, "especially if Congress fails to pass a big stimulus."
And with the balance of the next Senate currently up for grabs, with Democrats needing to sweep the January runoff elections in Georgia to win control, the prospects for a package sizable enough to match the needs of the country are, at best, uncertain.
So too is it for Biden and his transition team, which remains locked out of the agencies it is poised to take over after the inauguration, and cut off from information that could help in planning its way out of the current shambles. Emily Murphy, the Trump appointee who heads the General Services Administration, has given no indication of when, or if, she plans to exercise her power to acknowledge Biden as the "apparent" winner, which would open up crucial lines of communication and avail the President-elect''s team to millions of dollars in federal funds.
Jen Psaki, who is overseeing Biden''s nominations team, said Sunday that "the longer this goes, the longer it''s going to jeopardize people''s well being."
But legal action, she told Tapper on "State of the Union," isn''t the transition team''s "preference" for getting the GSA to formally begin the transition process.
"If it was, we would have done it days ago because we have known the clear outcome for two weeks now and that''s the only trigger for ascertainment," Psaki said.
She tweeted shortly after her interview with Tapper that Biden will name his first Cabinet picks on Tuesday -- a date also confirmed by White House chief of staff Ron Klain on ABC Sunday.
With Murphy stalling, Biden''s transition team is now seeking to effectively crowdsource its efforts. On Friday it sent a fundraising email to supporters as it weighs legal options.
"The nation faces too many challenges to not have a fully funded and smooth transition to prepare the President-elect and Vice President-elect to govern on Day One," a transition official told CNN.
But no amount of money can buy access to the classified briefings typically granted within days to election winners. Biden -- and the country -- appear condemned to wait for Trump to set aside his wounded pride and concede to reality.
The wait continues. The surge of death and despair does, too.

Yellen, who will be the first woman to hold the job should she be confirmed by the Senate, will be tasked to lead Biden''s economic response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has wreaked havoc on the economy and led millions of Americans to lose their jobs. She will also be asked to make good on the former vice president''s campaign promise to narrow the economic disparities between the rich and middle class and poor Americans.
Jen Psaki, a senior adviser for the Biden transition team, said, "The President-elect looks forward to announcing some members of his economic team early next week who will work with him to build the economy back better."
Biden''s decision was also a nod to divisions within his own party, which he has sought to keep at peace by selecting Cabinet and White House officials with appeal across ideological lines. The President-elect touted his Treasury pick -- then a mystery -- last week by promising in unusually explicit terms that it would be "someone who will be accepted by all elements of the Democratic Party, from the progressive to the moderate coalitions."
His prediction has largely come true.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren praised Yellen in a tweet responding to news of the coming nomination.
"Janet Yellen would be an outstanding choice for Treasury Secretary. She is smart, tough, and principled," Warren said. "As one of the most successful Fed Chairs ever, she has stood up to Wall Street banks, including holding Wells Fargo accountable for cheating working families."
Progressive groups like Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely allied with Warren, have praised Yellen as a groundbreaking pick and expressed confidence that she will drive a hard bargain with the big banks.
"Among those not named Elizabeth Warren, Janet Yellen is high up on the list of people favored by progressives and people across the Democratic Party," PCCC co-founder Adam Green said in a statement. "Biden knew that someone beholden to Wall Street would have undermined his ambitious economic campaign promises at the worst possible time. As Treasury Secretary, Yellen will faithfully implement the ambitious economic agenda Biden campaigned on."
But Yellen also holds an appeal among some in the business community, including those who feared Warren herself might be the choice, because she is viewed as a more predictable figure, in part because of her time as Fed chair, and the market''s strength during her tenure.
"Janet Yellen is brilliant and has a track record for being unflappable," Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments, said. "She seems to be popular in all factions, from the financial markets to Main Street."
The historic nature of Yellen''s nomination could also help with skeptical Democrats, though she is -- as Biden suggested -- unlikely to invite much pushback. And Republicans, who will keep control of the Senate if they don''t get swept in two Georgia Senate runoffs early next year, have previously voted to confirm Yellen, including in her nomination to Fed chair.
After a long career in academia and different federal reserve roles, Yellen was nominated by President Barack Obama to become chair of the Federal Reserve -- the first woman to hold the position -- in a role she filled from 2014 to 2018. President Donald Trump opted not to renominate Yellen during his first year in office, instead nominating Jerome Powell to take the top job.
On her final day in that office, the Fed hit Wells Fargo with heavy sanctions in response to what it described then as "widespread consumer abuses." That included its infamous creation of 3.5 million fake customer accounts.
The punishment capped the firm''s size and led to a pledge by the bank to ultimately remove four board members. It was, according to a Fed official, the first time the body every imposed cap on the assets of a financial institution.
"We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank," Yellen said before leaving her post.

Biden on Tuesday spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin of Ireland and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, according to Biden''s transition team. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said Monday that he had called Biden to congratulate him on his win.
Trump has yet to publicly concede and continues to make baseless claims of election rigging and voter fraud. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders in Congress are following the President''s lead and have not acknowledged Biden as the winner.
Biden said on Tuesday that he thinks Trump''s refusal to concede is an "embarrassment" and hurts the President''s legacy.
"I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful that the United States democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong and enduring," Biden said. "But I think at the end of the day, it''s all going to come to fruition on January 20, and between now and then, my hope and expectation is that the American people do know and do understand that there has been a transition."
The President''s refusal to accept his loss has stalled the required steps to transition government to Biden. Without a formal transition underway, foreign leaders have called former diplomats from the Obama administration to get the contact information for Biden''s team in order to call and congratulate him instead of using State Department channels, according to diplomatic officials familiar with how foreign governments approach a new administration.
Trump''s top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Tuesday refused to accept the Biden victory and said there would be "a smooth transition to a second Trump administration." Pompeo is set to travel later this week and next week to the Middle East and meet with several leaders who have already congratulated Biden and recognized him as the President-elect.
In a stark departure from Trump''s foreign policy and isolationist worldview, Biden''s calls with the foreign leaders focused on strengthening ties abroad and tackling global challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic and climate crisis, with the help of allies. All of his calls on Tuesday to foreign leaders mentioned the pandemic, the global climate crisis and global economic recovery, according to readouts provided by the Biden transition team.

The President-elect told Macron that he wanted to reinvigorate bilateral and trans-Atlantic ties, including through NATO and the European Union. They spoke about human rights and building global health security, and Biden expressed his readiness to work to address security and development in Africa, conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and Iran''s nuclear program.
Macron tweeted a photo of what appears to be himself on the phone with Biden and wrote, "We''ll have a lot to do together to promote shared priorities - climate, global health, international security - and effective multilateral action."
Biden similarly told Merkel that he looked forward to strengthening ties between the US and Germany, and expressed that he welcomed the opportunity to cooperate on a shared agenda with the EU. They spoke about the global challenges of containing the coronavirus pandemic, spurring a global economic recovery and addressing the climate crisis.
In his call to Martin, Biden reaffirmed his support for the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to decades of deadly sectarian violence across Ireland, and the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Martin tweeted that he had a "warm and engaging call" with Biden, praising the President-elect and saying he "brings tremendous knowledge & understanding to his new role, and has a great love for his Irish heritage." He said they had spoken about the importance of the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which Trump had announced the US was withdrawing from. He invited Biden and soon-to-be first lady Jill Biden to Ireland to "properly mark their success."
Biden and Johnson spoke for about 25 minutes, and the call was described as friendly by someone with knowledge of it. Biden told Johnson that he especially looks forward to working closely together on global challenges as the United Kingdom prepares to host the 2021 G-7 and the UN Climate Change Conference. They spoke about the pandemic and global health security, pursuing a sustainable economy recovery, combating climate change and strengthening democracy, among other topics. Biden expressed his interest in comparing shared priorities with the UK, NATO and the EU.
Macron tweeted that he and Biden had spoken about working together on a number of issues, including the climate crisis, the pandemic, trade, energy, NATO, racism and China''s detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and consultant Michael Spavor.', '2020-11-11 12:37:57');

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Trump has failed to provide any evidence of fraud, that his legal team was in shambles and that it''s time to put the country first.
"If you have got the evidence of fraud, present it," Christie said on ABC, where he is a contributor. He decried efforts by the President''s lawyers to smear Republican governors who have not gone along with the President''s false claims of voter malfeasance.
MAP: See 2020 election results
"Quite frankly, the conduct of the President''s legal team has been a national embarrassment," he said, singling out Trump attorney Sidney Powell''s accusations against Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp.
Georgia will conduct another recount of its presidential ballots following a Trump campaign request Saturday, but the recount is extremely unlikely to change his loss in the state. President-elect Joe Biden, who was declared the winner Friday as the state certified the results, has a 12,670 vote or .2% lead over Trump in Georgia.
"This is outrageous conduct by any lawyer," Christie said Sunday, noting Trump''s attorneys have levied wild accusations in public but have not, so far, raised them in court, where there are consequences for providing false information.
"They allege fraud outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom, they don''t plead fraud and they don''t argue fraud," he said.
"Listen," Christie concluded, "I have been a supporter of the President''s. I voted for him twice, but elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn''t happen."
"If you are unwilling to come forward and present the evidence, it must mean the evidence doesn''t exist," he went on. "The country is what has to matter the most. As much as I''m a strong Republican and I love my party, it''s the country that has to come first."
Later Sunday, Trump''s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis attempted to distance themselves from Powell, saying she "is practicing law on her own." Their statement comes just days after Powell joined Giuliani and Ellis for a wild news conference at Republican National Committee headquarters and a week after the President announced on Twitter that Powell was joining his legal team.
"I agree with the campaign''s statement that I am not part of the campaign''s legal team," Powell said in a statement later Sunday night. "I never signed a retainer agreement or sent the President or the campaign a bill for my expenses or fees. My intent has always been to expose all the fraud I could find and let the chips fall where they may--whether it be upon Republicans or Democrats," she added, vowing to file an "epic" lawsuit this week.
Maryland''s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan also sharply criticized Trump''s efforts on Sunday, telling CNN''s Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" that he''s "embarrassed that more people in the party aren''t speaking up" about what he called the "bizarre" moves.
"We used to go supervise elections around the world, and we were the most respected, you know, country with respect to elections. And now we''re beginning to look like we''re a banana republic. It''s time for them to stop the nonsense," Hogan said, adding that Trump''s meeting last week with members of the Michigan state Legislature''s Republican leadership -- as part of an effort to pressure local leaders on election results -- was "completely outrageous."
Trump shot back at Hogan later Sunday, saying in a tweet that the governor is a "RINO," or Republican in name only, who will "never make the grade." Hogan replied in his own tweet, urging the President to "stop golfing and concede."
Hogan, a moderate member of his party, is a known critic of Trump. He revealed last month that he cast a vote for Ronald Reagan in this year''s contest, making him one of the highest-profile Republicans to publicly withhold support from the President.
In addition to Hogan and Christie, a number of other notable Republicans have also publicly signaled that they support starting the formal presidential transition process, including Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
Republican Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan also stressed the need for a smooth transition process on Sunday, saying that the absence of one injects unnecessary uncertainty into the incoming administration.
"By not allowing the security briefings, the health briefings, the normal transition from one president to the next only brings about more uncertainty and threatens that peaceful transition that would otherwise -- that would certainly undermine, then, the next administration," he told CNN''s Dana Bash on "Inside Politics."
"When you slow it down, when you fail to certify the results, when you add all this uncertainty, it only makes it very problematic, then, for the next administration to start with their feet hitting the ground," Upton said.

Now dozens are self-quarantining.', 'Devan Cole', 'Election workers risked their health this year to staff polling and ballot counting centers amid the coronavirus pandemic, and now more than two dozen are self-quarantining after being potentially exposed to workers who recently tested positive for the virus.

Though it remains unclear how many election workers nationwide might have contracted the deadly virus and unknowingly exposed others to it, the reported cases come during some of the worst moments of the pandemic thus far, with the fall surge seeing some of the highest days of new reported Covid-19 cases in the US. On Election Day alone, the US reported about 85,200 cases.
The incidents also underscore the case Democrats and public health officials made for mail-in ballots in the run-up to the election, as they urged voters to try to avoid voting at polling centers, where infection could spread.
In New York''s Dutchess County, an Election Day poll worker who was asymptomatic tested positive for the virus, according to the county''s Department of Behavioral and Community Health commissioner, Dr. Anil Vaidian.
The worker was wearing a mask and following social distancing guidelines, things Vaidian said made the risk to voters "minimal," though he encouraged anyone who had used the site the person worked at to monitor for symptoms.
Still, "other poll workers who had sustained contact with the individual are being quarantined and will be tested under health and safety guidelines and protocols," Vaidian said in a statement on Friday.
"This is an important reminder that the virus is still present in our community," he added.
In Michigan, a worker counting absentee ballots in Ingham County tested positive for the virus, clerk Barb Byrum said in a statement on Thursday.
Byrum said the person was asymptomatic "and had only been tested as a precaution due to the potential exposure of another family member."
All the workers who were in the same room with the infected worker are now self-quarantining, she said.
An election worker in New Haven, Connecticut, also tested positive for coronavirus, forcing 12 staff members in the city''s clerk''s office to self-quarantine for two weeks, according Maritza Bond, the city''s director of public health.
Bond said in a statement that the individual had "showed initial systems" of Covid-19 last week and had not returned to work since then, and that they received their positive test result on Election Day.
The "facilities have been cleaned and disinfected to ensure that we can reduce the spread of Covid-19," the statement read.
In California, Melinda Dubroff, San Joaquin County''s registrar of voters, announced early on Election Day that a worker who had been staffing a voting center had tested positive for the virus. The infection led 16 other workers to self-quarantine and resulted in a deep cleaning of the facility and new election workers being brought in for that center.
Dubroff said contact tracing was underway for about 50 people who had dropped off ballots at the site in the days preceding the positive test, as well as for approximately 200 people who had voted in person at the site.', '2020-11-07 12:40:57');

The former vice president is the first Democratic nominee to triumph in Georgia since Bill Clinton did it in 1992.

Biden''s victory adds 16 electoral votes to his tally, bringing him to 306 -- matching President Donald Trump''s 2016 total. With CNN''s projection that Trump will win North Carolina, the final tally is 306-232, a landslide for the President-elect, who flipped five states and a congressional district in Nebraska from red to blue in 2020.
The symmetry provides the President with yet another bitter pill to swallow. Trump has spent years tweeting and talking up his margin of victory against Hillary Clinton -- one that has now been turned on its head in a final, national rebuke of his presidency.
In Georgia, Trump had raced out to an early lead in the counting, but Biden surged ahead as the votes from Atlanta and its suburbs were tabulated.
The Democratic ticket''s historic success has been fueled by a grassroots organizing renaissance that rallied a rapidly diversifying electorate and suburbs that are, at once, growing and becoming increasingly inhospitable to Republican candidates. Georgia Republicans have compounded the issue, with state lawmakers refusing so far to expand Medicaid under Obamacare and Gov. Brian Kemp, in 2019, signed a so-called "heartbeat bill," one of the country''s most restrictive abortion laws.
Biden''s success in a traditionally Republican state is the culmination of slow, steady gains there by the party. Two years ago, Democrat Stacey Abrams fell narrowly short in her bid for governor, losing to Kemp by 1.4 percentage points. Her campaign, and the work she''s done since then, has focused on bringing out Democratic voters who had stayed home in previous cycles. That set the stage for Biden, a moderate, to win big in the counties overlapping and outside Atlanta, a city at the heart of the New South.
"We have been working at this for more than a decade. And there have been dozens of organizations and hundreds of people who''ve made this their primary mission," Abrams told CNN''s Jake Tapper this week on "State of the Union." "I have been privileged to be able to bring to bear resources, both before the election of 2018 and then the $40 million we were able to spend in 2018 to build a Democratic infrastructure that may not have yielded a victory for me in 2018, but certainly yielded a victory this week."
Democratic presidential candidates have been closing the gap on their Republican rivals in recent elections. But none had repeated Bill Clinton''s feat from 28 years ago, when he defeated incumbent George H.W. Bush. Barack Obama came close. Hillary Clinton, in 2016, got closer. Biden completed the project.
Sensing opportunity in the final days of the race, vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, who was joined by Abrams, and Obama both visited the state. Apparently anxious over a shift toward Biden, Trump also touched down in Georgia on the weekend before Election Day.
As Biden gained ground in the days after the election, so too did Democratic Senate challenger Jon Ossoff in his campaign to unseat Republican Sen. David Perdue. Neither ended up reaching a majority of all the votes, meaning both their race and the special election for the state''s other Senate seat, are headed to runoffs on January 5.
The results of those contests, Perdue against Ossoff in one race and Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock taking on GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler in the other, will determine which party holds the Senate majority next year. Democrats would need to win both to swing the numbers in their favor.
Loeffler and Perdue, though, are facing the prospect of running without Trump on the ballot. Still, they are trying to grab on to his coattails by crediting his outrageous, bogus claims of mass voter fraud. The pair even called for the resignation of Georgia''s Republican secretary of state, who refused.
Because the presidential race was so close, with Biden up by a little more than 14,000 votes, the state began an audit on Thursday morning. It is due to be completed next week. But the Trump campaign can, even if the margin is unchanged, request a subsequent hand recount.', '2020-11-13 12:53:08');

Earlier in the day, a federal judge had rejected a GOP request to invalidate 127,000 ballots cast in drive-thru early voting but said he would have ruled against allowing such voting on Election Day. The judge had dismissed the petition on technical grounds after finding the Republicans did not have a legal basis to bring the challenge.
In announcing the decision to close most of the drive-thru locations, Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins said on Twitter that he "cannot in good faith encourage voters to cast their votes in tents if that puts their votes at risk." The location that will remain open is the Toyota Center, which has "walls and a roof" and would fit the judge''s description as a building, a county clerk spokesperson told CNN. The judge had ruled that voting needed to take place in a "structure."
Just before Hollins'' announcement, Republicans challenging voting in Texas'' Harris County had asked a federal appeals court to block drive-thru voting on Election Day, after losing a bid earlier in the day to invalidate all drive-thru voting in the Democratic-leaning area, which includes Houston. A panel of judges from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals denied that request early Tuesday morning.
In their appeal, the Republicans dropped their request to invalidate the ballots already cast but left open the door to doing so later.
The lawsuit seeking to void the 127,000 early votes was a major last-minute challenge to voting rules in closely watched states ahead of the election, in which some officials have made special accommodations amid the coronavirus pandemic.
"When you balance the harms you''ve got to weigh in favor of that - in counting the votes," Judge Andrew Hanen ruled earlier Monday after a nearly three-hour hearing. The judge noted that people have been voting using the drive-thru tents since mid-October and the petition to invalidate those votes was filed only late last week.
Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush, rejected the Republicans'' arguments on a technical matter but also said he would have ruled against them since the lawsuit was filed well after thousands of people had voted.
Sunday, the all-Republican Texas state Supreme Court denied a similar petition on drive-thru ballots. Roughly 10% of the votes cast in-person during the early voting period have been cast at those sites.
In a separate case in Nevada on Monday, a judge rejected a Republican lawsuit seeking to halt early counting in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, over the stringency of signature-matching computer software and how closely observers can watch votes being counted.
President Donald Trump and Republican officials have repeatedly made baseless claims of voter fraud and sought to cast doubt on measures including voting by mail and the use of dropboxes.
Judge warns about drive-in sites for Election Day
Throughout the hearing in Houston, Hanen appeared to grapple with the idea that nearly 127,000 people had already voted in the drive-thru polling centers and whether, if he invalided the process, they would be able to vote on Election Day.
"A lot of people would say, ''Gee, if I had known there was a question about voting drive-in, I would have parked my car and walked to the polls,''" Hanen said.
Reading his ruling, Hanen noted that the case may be appealed to the New Orleans-based appeals court, and suggested that were it returned on appeal, he may move to stop Harris County from offering drive-thru voting on Tuesday.
Hanen said Texas election law requires ballots to be cast inside a building, and, "I don''t find a tent to be a building."
"I would not vote in a drive thru out of my concern whether that''s legal or not," Hanen said, ordering Harris County to maintain records of ballots cast at those sites on Tuesday in the event of future legal challenges.
The judge later issued a written order further explaining his reasoning.
Hollins had earlier said drive-thru voting will continue on Election Day.
"We will have drive-thru voting open tomorrow. We will count those votes. And we want to make clear that voter access in Texas and in America is a constitutional right that we will protect," Hollins said after the hearing.
"We will give voters on Election Day the same rights, the same conveniences that every other voter has had during the early voting period," Hollins added.
During the hearing, Christina Ford, an attorney representing Democratic parties that intervened in the case, emphasized the potential difficulty to voters who cast their ballots to try and cast a new one.
Ford said that provisional ballots do not have a check box on them to reflect that the voter had cast a ballot at a drive-thru location and that if a voter is found to have intent to vote twice it is a criminal offense.
Voters relied on county officials, Ford said, and invalidating their ballots would "cause mass confusion" and create a "frantic situation with voters trying to figure out if they could cast a provisional ballot."
Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said the lawsuit never should have been brought in the first place.
"Texans who lawfully voted at drive through locations should have never had to fear that their votes wouldn''t be counted and their voices wouldn''t be heard," Hinojosa said. "This lawsuit was shameful and it should have never seen the light of day."
Former Vice President Joe Biden''s campaign called the ruling a "victory for Texas voters."
In a statement, the campaign''s Texas State Director Rebecca Acuña said: "Today is a victory for Texas voters and the more than 120,000 Texans who followed the rules, made a plan to drive-in vote, and exercised their constitutional right."
The hearing began at 10:30 a.m. CT, but public access was limited at the start.
Reporters and other members of the public were granted access to a teleconference about an hour after the hearing began. A phone line that had been set up for access broke down as the hearing was about to begin. Reporters inside the courthouse were held in the lobby and not allowed into the courtroom due to social distancing measures put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.
About 90 minutes after the hearing began, those reporters were eventually allowed into the courtroom.
Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the lawsuit fits a broader pattern of GOP-led lawsuits claiming voter fraud.
"Like so many 11th-hour voting-related suits filed by Republicans in recent weeks, this suit has almost nothing to do with voter fraud," Vladeck, who has intervened on behalf of the defendants, wrote in an op-ed published in The Washington Post.
"Rather, it''s the latest in a consistent and cynical line of suits -- in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, among others -- that appear motivated by partisan gain, assuming that the exclusion of any set of ballots from Harris County ... is good for Republicans."', '2020-11-03 12:54:40');

Greg Abbott issued a proclamation Thursday limiting the amount of drop-off locations for mail-in ballots to one site per county.

The move significantly affects the Democratic stronghold of Harris County, which is the state''s largest county by population -- one of the most populous in the country -- and covers a massive area. It must now reduce its 12 drop-off locations down to one starting on Friday, according to Elizabeth Lewis, spokeswoman for the Harris County Clerk''s Office. Travis County, which includes the reliably Democratic city of Austin, must limit its four drop-off locations to one.
Other large counties -- like Tarrant, Dallas and El Paso County -- only had one drop-off location already in place.
The Republican governor said in a statement the order was made to enhance ballot security. It also allows poll watchers to observe the in-person delivery of mail-in ballots by voters, but critics say it could severely limit access for many voters.
"The State of Texas has a duty to voters to maintain the integrity of our elections," Abbott said. "As we work to preserve Texans'' ability to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must take extra care to strengthen ballot security protocols throughout the state. These enhanced security protocols will ensure greater transparency and will help stop attempts at illegal voting."
The decision has already drawn fire from Texas Democrats.
Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in Harris County, told CNN''s Chris Cuomo on "PrimeTime" Thursday evening, "There is no reason for this decision to limit us to one drop-off location other than voter suppression."
Calling the drop-off sites "secure" and "safe," Hidalgo urged Texas residents to consider, "If these leaders truly are doing right by you, why are they so afraid of you voting?"
"I''m reminding our residents here in Harris County, our citizens, that we are not to be intimidated. That this is a time to participate, and, yes, it''s going to be harder and, yes, they''re trying to confuse and they''re trying to suppress the vote, but for that very reason, we need to show everyone who''s watching that we''re going to participate because it''s about democracy."
The state''s Democratic party chair, Gilberto Hinojosa, labeled the step a "blatant voter suppression tactic" in a press release. The group Let America Vote also blasted the move.
"The governor is making it harder for people to vote in the middle of a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of over 16,000 Texans," the group said in a statement. "It is a shameful, blatant act of voter suppression that will disproportionately impact the large number of Black and Latinx voters in Texas'' biggest counties."
Former Democratic presidential candidate and Texas native Julian Castro similarly cast Abbott''s proclamation as an effort to make voting "harder for fellow Texans."
The Republican governor, he tweeted, "knows how angry Texans are with Trump''s failure, (Republican Sen. John) Cornyn''s failure and his own to keep Texans safe and our people working."
In July, Abbott issued an order expanding the amount of time for early voting by six days and for hand-delivering mail-in ballots out of safety concerns due to the pandemic.
Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins said in a statement that Abbott was going back on his word with the proclamation, having expanded access to voting with that earlier order.
"Going back on his word at this point harms voters and will result in widespread confusion and voter suppression. Many mail ballots have already been dropped off by voters across Harris County, and multiple drop-off locations have been advertised for weeks," Hollins said.
"Our office is more than willing to accommodate poll watchers at mail ballot drop-off locations. But to force hundreds of thousands of seniors and voters with disabilities to use a single drop-off location in a county that stretches over nearly 2,000 square miles is prejudicial and dangerous."
A pair of recent court rulings -- one in favor of age limits for no-excuse mail voting and one against the sending of mail-in ballot applications to residents in Harris County -- have enraged Texas Democrats and voting rights activists.
Texas has been traditionally Republican over the last several decades, but Democrats think it is in play in the November election. Multiple polls have found a tight race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in the Lone Star State, with several indicating the candidates were separated by only 1 point in July.
Abbott''s stated concerns about "attempts at illegal voting" in Texas come as the President continues to lean into a conspiratorial message around the US voting process and particularly mail-in voting.
While rare instances of voter fraud from mail-in ballots do occur, it is nowhere near a widespread problem in the US election system.
In fact, mail ballot fraud is exceedingly rare in part because states have systems and processes in place to prevent forgery, theft and voter fraud. These systems would apply to both absentee ballots and mail-in ballots for in-state voters.

Krebs'' dismissal underscores the lengths Trump is willing to go to punish those who don''t adopt his conspiratorial view of the election. Since CNN and other outlets called the race for President-elect Joe Biden, Trump has refused to accept the results, instead pushing baseless conspiracies that his second term is being stolen.
This includes falsely claiming during an election night address that he had already won reelection, that he had won states that were actually still up in the air at the time and that his opponents were perpetuating a fraud.
In the lead-up to the election, Krebs had often quietly disputed the President''s repeated false claims about mail-in ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies.
But in the days that have followed, Krebs has adopted a more forceful approach regularly posting on Twitter -- often with blaring red siren emojis -- fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by Trump, his allies and supporters around the country.
While his pushback at the President''s falsehoods had frustrated some at DHS, Krebs was responsible for a widely praised revamp of the department''s cybersecurity efforts and increasing coordination with state and local governments, as the first director of CISA.
He served as one of the most key federal national security officials that oversaw an election that by all accounts went very smoothly.
Foreign adversaries were not able to affect any of the votes, CISA said, and it was "the most secure election in American history," according to them and the wider group of public and private election officials. That was the statement for which the President decided to fire Krebs on Tuesday evening.
News of his dismissal drew quick outrage from elected officials and election security experts.
Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine and co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in a statement, "By firing Mr. Krebs for simply doing his job, President Trump is inflicting severe damage on all Americans -- who rely on CISA''s defenses, even if they don''t know it."
"If there''s any silver lining in this unjust decision, it''s this: I hope that President-elect Biden will recognize Chris''s contributions, and consult with him as the Biden administration charts the future of this critically important agency," King said.
In one notably forceful rebuke, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump''s decision "pathetic."
"Instead of rewarding this great service, President Trump is retaliating against Director Krebs and other officials who did their duty. It''s pathetic, but sadly predictable that upholding and protecting our democratic processes would be cause for firing," Schiff said.
Former DHS general counsel John Mitnick, also blasted Krebs'' firing as "outrageous but not surprising."
"@realDonaldTrump has made a habit of firing those who are highly competent, have integrity and courage, and stand up for the #RuleOfLaw. To @CISAKrebs: it was an honor to serve with you @DHSgov, and you should wear this as a badge of honor," he tweeted.
Ben Hovland, a Trump appointee who is chairman of the US Election Assistance Commission, praised Krebs during an interview with CNN''s Erin Burnett on "OutFront" as a "great director" who "showed a lot of leadership, particularly in the election space."
Asked about the President''s false claims of massive voter fraud, Hovland explained, "When you talk to election officials across the country, they''re confident in the security of this election. They''re confident in the outcome of the election -- that this was a fair election and that Americans made their voices heard, and we''ve got to respect the will of the people and the public servants that helped run this election and make this all possible."
Krebs'' firing also prompted some notable pushback from Republicans.
Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, defended Krebs'' work to CNN shortly after his dismissal.
"I know Chris. I''ve worked well with him. I think he''s a real professional," the Republican said.
Asked if he wished Trump hadn''t fired Krebs, Portman said: "Yeah, I think he was very good. I think what he was trying to do in an unprecedented way was to connect with every state in the country, and give them what they needed to protect and have a firewall in place to protect against cyber attacks."
Krebs kept up the fact check of the President''s conspiracy-mongering until the final hours of his tenure, tweeting earlier Tuesday that claims of manipulation of election systems "either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent."
He was quoting from a letter signed by 59 election specialists that also said that "anyone asserting that a US election was ''rigged'' is making an extraordinary claim" and called them "alarming assertions."
Firing Krebs, a US official previously told CNN, would "cross a red line" and set off alarm bells throughout the national security apparatus.
Marcus Fowler, a former CIA officer who now works as the director of strategic threat at the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, described Krebs to CNN as "a Dr. (Anthony) Fauci-like figure for election and cyber security, speaking truth to power about the security of the election based on the facts on the ground and the analysis of his subject matter experts."
"His forced departure at this critical time will absolutely degrade our national security, sends a horrible message and exposes vulnerability to our adversaries, and puts the credibility of the core democratic value of voting at risk of being undermined, manipulated, and hijacked," Fowler said.
Still, his dismissal comes after several of the Pentagon''s most senior civilian officials were replaced with officials perceived as loyal to the President, and reports of Trump''s increasing frustration with CIA Director Gina Haspel.

Bossie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has been in the campaign headquarters in Virginia several times in the last week and has also traveled extensively.
Bloomberg News first reported the diagnosis.
Bossie, 55, is the president of the conservative nonprofit Citizens United. He previously served as a deputy campaign manager on Trump''s 2016 presidential campaign.
Earlier Monday, CNN confirmed that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson tested positive for coronavirus.
Bossie and Carson were among several individuals in Trump''s orbit to have tested positive following public, campaign-related events.
According to a tweet from another Trump political adviser, Corey Lewandowski, Bossie traveled to a Trump rally in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on November 2 aboard Air Force One. Lewandowski shared a photo of the cabin that included former Republican National Committee Chair Reince Preibus and first daughter Tiffany Trump seated at the table with Bossie. No one in the photo wore a mask.
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and four others in Trump''s orbit also tested positive for coronavirus last week.
People in the 50-to-64 age range, such as Bossie, face four times greater risk of hospitalization and 30 times greater risk of death from coronavirus than individuals age 18 to 29, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Men are more likely than women to suffer severe illness or die from coronavirus, according to the CDC.

Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to his Cabinet, suggesting he would instead like to keep them in the US Senate to help him carry out a progressive agenda.

Biden told NBC in an interview aired Tuesday night that there is already "significant representation among progressives in our administration," but said "there''s nothing really off the table."
"But one thing is really critical: taking someone out of the Senate, taking someone out of the House (of Representatives), particularly a person of consequence, is really a difficult decision that would have to be made," Biden said. "I have a very ambitious, very progressive agenda, and it''s going to take really strong leaders in the House and Senate to get it done."
Biden said he was open to considering naming a Republican who voted for President Donald Trump to a spot in his administration, saying, "I want this country to be united. The purpose of our administration is, once again, uniting. We can''t keep this virulent political dialogue going. It has to end."
The comments are likely to discourage those on the left who want to see Biden name progressive champions in top roles in his administration.
Sanders has recently ramped up a campaign to become Labor secretary in Biden''s Cabinet and has sought the support of top labor leaders, CNN previously reported. In a particularly direct comment to CNN''s Wolf Blitzer earlier this month, the self-described Democratic socialist said he would accept the nomination if it were offered to him. "If I had a portfolio that allowed me to stand up and fight for working families, would I do it? Yes, I would," Sanders said.
Warren has been a progressive favorite to lead the Treasury Department, but CNN reported this week that Biden will choose Janet Yellen, former chair of the Federal Reserve, as his secretary of the Treasury. Warren praised Yellen as an "outstanding choice for Treasury Secretary" in a tweet on Monday, describing her as "smart, tough, and principled," and "one of the most successful Fed Chairs ever."
"I''d look forward to working with Secretary Yellen to strengthen our economy, tackle inequality, and protect consumers," Warren wrote in a second tweet.
If Biden is ruling out elected lawmakers, it wouldn''t only affect high-profile names like Warren and Sanders. Michigan Rep. Andy Levin has been endorsed by a number of unions as a candidate to run the Labor Department and Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge has support in some quarters to be the next Secretary of Agriculture. Both would see their paths to Cabinet positions cut off by a de facto ban on appointments from the ranks of Congress.
Warren and Sanders are both from states with Republican governors, which means if they were to leave the Senate to join the administration the governors have the power to appoint Republicans to fill their seats until a special election. But Vermont Gov. Phil Scott has suggested he would fill the seat with an independent who would caucus with Democrats, as Sanders does.
Republicans currently control the Senate by a razor-thin margin, but control of the Senate will be determined by two runoff elections in Georgia in early January.
Whether Republicans keep control of the Senate could affect who Biden nominates and who gets confirmed with a majority vote. Warren and Sanders are stars on the progressive left and could have a hard time winning Republican or even a few moderate Democrats'' votes.
Biden has already announced several senior White House staff members and Cabinet-level positions as he continues to build out his administration. His first announcement that Ron Klain would serve as White House chief of staff was praised by both establishment Democrats and party progressives. Warren called Klain a "superb choice" who has "earned trust all across the entire Democratic Party," and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Klain''s selection was "good news and an encouraging choice."
On Tuesday, Biden introduced six key members of his national security and foreign policy teams, and each of his appointees and nominees delivered remarks at an event in Wilmington, Delaware. He named Antony Blinken as his choice for secretary of state, Alejandro Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security, Avril Haines as director of national intelligence, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as US ambassador to the United Nations, Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and John Kerry as special presidential envoy for climate.

The current attacks by Trump and fellow Republican leaders on valid election results, without any evidence, represent more than a flailing attempt to keep Trump in the White House. They amount to the ultimate disdain in a democracy. Voting is cherished as a basic, universal right, because when people cannot choose their representatives, they lose a path toward ensuring other rights.
Trump''s disregard for the franchise, particularly when it comes to that for Blacks and Latinos, culminates a pattern of scorning democratic norms that began four years ago.
It is a pattern that has been deep and disturbing, yet somehow so routine and predictable that it fails to provoke widescale public outrage.
As president, Trump has derided the justice system and tried to delegitimatize individual judges on a regular basis. He challenged accepted principles by declaring certain suspects guilty or deserving of the death penalty, even before a hearing. He opposed any due process for people who had come to the US seeking asylum. He said he wanted an end to birthright citizenship, despite its guarantee in the Constitution''s 14th Amendment.
As Trump has tried to dehumanize immigrants and racial minorities, he has attempted to delegitimize officials in positions to protect against the arbitrary denial of individual life and liberty. Soon after taking office, he disparaged one federal jurist as a "so-called judge."
Now election officials and systems have drawn his wrath. This week he fired Chris Krebs, the Department of Homeland Security official who rejected Trump''s unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.
President-elect Joe Biden, to be sure, has called out Trump''s baseless moves to erode public confidence in the election results. When he was asked on Thursday what message Trump''s refusal to concede sends to Americans, Biden replied, "I think they''re witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions. ... I don''t know his motive, but I just think it''s totally irresponsible."
Trump and his allies have not been deterred. They persist in trying to reverse the election results, even as they continue to lose in courts across the country with their groundless claims. They lost three challenges Thursday -- in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
It also emerged on Thursday that the President earlier this week personally contacted two Republican canvass board members from Michigan''s Wayne County who had reluctantly certified election results from that county covering Detroit. Trump has repeatedly targeted the majority-Black city of Detroit, writing baselessly on Twitter on Thursday, "Voter Fraud in Detroit is rampant, and has been for many years!"
His personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani claimed, in the same vein, with no evidence on Thursday that people from Camden, New Jersey, vote in Philadelphia. "They do it every year," he said of people in the heavily African-American city. "Happens all the time in Philly."
From the start of Trump''s time on the national stage, he has stoked racial divisions.
When he was running for the White House in 2016, he declared of Mexicans, "they''re bringing drugs, they''re bringing crime, they''re rapists." He said to Black people, "you''re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs." He claimed a US federal judge would be naturally biased against him because the judge, born in Indiana, was of Mexican heritage.
Among Trump''s prominent campaign promises: keeping Muslims out of the US and building a wall at the Southern border.
After the May police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and renewed Black Lives Matter momentum, Trump stepped up his support of police. "The only way you will stop the violence in the high crime Democrat run cities is through strength," Trump said. He also cheered on caravans of his supporters that arrived in cities to confront BLM protesters.
The first of Trump''s glaring racial remarks as President came in August 2017 after the killing of a woman in Charlottesville, Virginia, during protests begun by White supremacists. Klansmen and neo-Nazis, some carrying torches, demonstrated against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides," he said, later adding that there were "very fine people on both sides."
Among those incensed by Trump''s remarks was Biden, who said they helped prompt his presidential run against Trump. Biden said Trump''s description of "fine people" on both sides "assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it."
Around the same time, Trump used his first presidential pardon on former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his racial-profiling practices and convicted of contempt of court for refusing to stop his unlawful detention policies.
Trump repeatedly criticized the FBI''s role in investigating Russia''s interference in the 2016 election, pushing a discredited claim that the FBI spied on his campaign. He has used the word "scum" to refer to FBI employees he believed acted improperly.
At the start of 2020, Trump''s pattern of delegitimizing institutions was seen in his scorn for the case against his political strategist Roger Stone. Trump referred to the possibility of "a bad jury."
And continuing to fume about federal investigators, he said in a February appearance in Las Vegas, "So we had a lot of dirty cops. FBI is phenomenal. I love the people in the FBI. But the people at the top were dirty cops."
The remarks reflected his preoccupation with former FBI director James Comey, who first led the Russia investigation.
Now, Trump''s focus is on the people who counted ballots this month. He has homed in on Detroit, where he falsely claimed on Wednesday, "there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan."
Biden, in fact, has a lead of about 158,000 votes over Trump in the state''s count.
"We won Michigan," Biden said on Thursday. "It''s going to be certified. ... It''s hard to fathom how this man thinks. ... I''m confident he knows he hasn''t won and is not going to be able to win, and we''re going to be sworn in on January 20th."', '2020-11-24 16:05:23');

Klain, tapped for the top Biden role on Wednesday, has been at the absolute center of Supreme Court confirmations for three decades, as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee and as a leading lawyer in the Clinton and Obama administrations.
And Klain himself did not bypass the Third Branch. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he served as a Supreme Court law clerk in 1987 and 1988.
He traversed all three branches simultaneously in spring 1993 when President Bill Clinton chose Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a high court vacancy.
As Justice Byron White was preparing to announce his retirement, he asked his former clerk Klain to visit his chambers. White gave Klain, then an associate White House counsel, a resignation letter to deliver to Clinton.
Soon after, Klain synchronized with Biden, then the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, over the administration''s search for a new justice. Klain had been chief counsel to Biden on the committee from 1989 to 1992, including during the controversial 1991 Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings.
Clinton''s selection of a successor to White took several turns, as the President''s team considered other candidates before landing on Ginsburg, three months after the March day on which White handed Klain the letter.
The 59-year-old Indiana native, who was chief of staff to then-Vice President Biden, is clearly steeped in relevant government service to today''s crises. During the Obama years, he oversaw the administration''s response to an Ebola outbreak.
The Supreme Court could present a distinct opportunity for a deeper Biden legacy in the law. Justices, along with federal trial and appellate judges, are appointed for life.
With the recent death of Ginsburg and succession of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the high court is now dominated by a new 6-3 conservative-liberal majority. It would plainly take more than a single Democratic appointment to alter the far-right control.
Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal 1994 Clinton appointee, is 82. Justice Clarence Thomas, named by President George H.W. Bush, is 72, and Samuel Alito, named by President George W. Bush, is 70.
Of those three eldest justices, the most likely to step down in the next four years would be Breyer.
But Supreme Court politics can take surprising twists.
In early 2016, when Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly, President Barack Obama chose US Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the nomination for nearly a year.
The Scalia vacancy then became President Donald Trump''s to fill after his November 2016 election.
Klain, who had left the Obama administration by 2016, had earlier advised Obama on his Supreme Court elevations of then-US appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and then-US Solicitor General Elena Kagan in 2010. (Klain and Kagan were students together at Harvard Law School.)
During the March 2017 confirmation hearings for Justice Neil Gorsuch, Klain and conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt participated in a Washington Post online discussion.
As Hewitt criticized some tough questions, saying most senators had abandoned "old standards of civility," Klain countered, "Yes, they were pointed -- but this isn''t patty-cake. At stake is a life-tenured appointment to the nation''s highest court. ... The questions should be hard -- and they certainly were for Justices Sotomayor and Kagan."
During Kagan''s confirmation, in fact, when then-Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions tried to pin down Kagan on her liberalism, he referred to Klain. The Alabama Republican noted that Klain had described Kagan as "clearly a legal progressive ... I do not think there''s any mystery to the fact that she is."
Was that characterization correct, Sessions asked the nominee.
"I love my good friend Ron Klain," Kagan responded, "but I guess I think that people should be allowed to label themselves, and ... I guess I''m not going to characterize it one way or another "

Between now and then, we can expect to see the last-minute pardon-fest undertaken by most presidents -- which any betting person would wager Trump is going to undertake in a very big way.
Trump has already commuted the sentence of his informal adviser Roger Stone. On Wednesday, he announced he had granted a "full pardon" to his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to the FBI but had been trying to take back the plea. But his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is still in home confinement serving out a prison sentence.
There''s a long list of other people Trump could also grant the favor of a presidential pardon. One question that will loom until he leaves office is whether he could grant that favor to himself.
Trump has repeatedly asked aides about pardons for himself and his family members and whether he could issue them preemptively, according to a recent CNN report.
Why would Trump need a pardon?
It may very well be an academic question since Trump does not currently seem to be facing federal criminal investigations. His attorney general, Bill Barr, has made very clear he''d follow existing Department of Justice guidance that prevents a sitting President from being charged with a crime.
Related: Six lawsuits Trump will have to deal with when he leaves office
Yet Trump''s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has served time in jail for breaking federal campaign finance law to engineer hush money payments in 2016 to women who said they had affairs with the soon-to-be President. There''s audio of Trump discussing the payments. It is, perhaps, conceivable he could pardon himself for breaking election law.
Those payments are also at the center of an inquiry into Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, who has been seeking Trump''s financial records in a long-running court battle.
But presidential pardons do no good for state crimes. In terms of these state inquiries into his financial affairs and his now-defunct charity, a federal pardon won''t do him any good in state court in New York.
If he gets creative, perhaps he could also try to use a self-pardon to deal with a potential future federal tax judgment against him. The IRS, for instance, says he incorrectly claimed a $72.9 million tax writeoff, according to the New York Times reporting on his tax returns.
Trump clearly believes he has the power to pardon himself
He said so back in 2018, after the Russia investigation concluded, Trump claimed the power, but he also pointed out the political jeopardy he''d face in using it.
"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?"
Yet, as CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams pointed out, a self-pardon would in effect be admitting some form of guilt.
"A pardon is actually in effect an acknowledgment that wrongdoing or a chargeable crime has happened. So he wouldn''t just be looking guilty, he''d be acknowledging that he committed an offense," Williams said during a November 12 appearance on CNN.
To the extent there''s an open question about self-pardons, it''s because no other US president had the audacity to think he could do it. The Constitution doesn''t expressly forbid it in writing, although it does forbid pardons in cases of impeachment. But that doesn''t mean Trump could do it.
The rules date back to Richard Nixon
There was a legal memo written by the Department of Justice''s Office of Legal Counsel just days before Nixon''s resignation in 1974 that argued a president could not self-pardon.
The Justice Department''s position was quite simple: "Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, it would seem that the question should be answered in the negative."
That''s a legal opinion, not law, but much like the opinion that a sitting president can''t be charged with a crime, these things take on the feel of precedent. Instead, Nixon''s successor and former vice president, Gerald Ford, gave his old boss an unconditional pardon a month later, probably scuttling Ford''s own ambition to be elected President.
Ford made an expansive declaration, wiping Nixon''s slate clean and handing him "a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9,1974."
What are Trump''s other options?
Trump does have other moves available to him, according to the memo. He could, like Nixon, resign and hand power in his final days to Vice President Mike Pence, who could pardon him.
He could even temporarily hand Pence power under the 25th Amendment and let Pence, as acting president, pardon him.
"The problem is that''s fraught with peril politically for Mike Pence, because ultimately he would be stepping into a political timebomb," said Williams, who pointed out Pence very clearly may want to run for president on his own.
It could also open Pence up to allegations of bribery if he and Trump had a pardon agreement in place. Pence would be receiving something of value -- the presidency, even for a short time -- in exchange for an official act.

"It doesn''t matter who you voted for; where you stood before Election Day," Biden said Monday. "It doesn''t matter your party, your point of view. We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democrat or Republican lives -- American lives."
Read here about Biden''s approach to Covid
Among Biden''s advisers is Rick Bright, who was fired from the Trump administration and registered as a whistleblower, saying he was pushed out for raising concerns about the approach to Covid under Trump.
Biden''s other advisers:
former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy
former Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler
Yale University''s Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith
Dr. Luciana Borio, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations
Dr. Zeke Emanuel, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act and an ex-Obama health adviser.
Biden''s team has not yet approached Dr. Deborah Birx, who has worked with Trump''s Covid task force and wants to continue in government service.

: Trump, fired by voters, fires his own defense secretary
Trump''s not yet willing to admit he was fired by voters, but he was more than happy to fire his secretary of defense on Monday.
Sure, he was frustrated by Mark Esper''s unwillingness to use the US military against American protesters, and they disagreed on policy.
But Trump''s move, which may have made a President who is losing his power feel briefly powerful, only adds to the perception that the US leader is flailing his way to the exit.
It does not appear that Trump has the ability to fire, say, Dr. Anthony Fauci, as he''s previously suggested, but he could send FBI Director Christopher Wray packing and had already been considering firing Wray, according to The Washington Post.
Wray''s term currently lasts until 2027, so firing him would simply hand the appointment to Biden unless Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell conspire to push someone else through.
Cabinet officials and political appointees will be looking for work in January, although the head of the White House personnel office has, according to CNN reporting, made it clear he''ll fire anyone early who he hears has been looking for a job. Read more about that and everything else that''s going on inside the Trump West Wing.
In other news about Trump aides, HUD Secretary Ben Carson has contracted Covid, after appearing maskless at Trump campaign events in the lead-up to Election Day. So has David Bossie, the adviser overseeing the Trump campaign''s legal challenges, according to CNN''s Kaitlan Collins and Kate Bennett.
They are the latest in the string of Trump officials, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, to come down with the disease at the end of the campaign.
: What happens to Trumpism?
Trump may not be President much longer, but Trumpism is probably here to stay, in some form or another, after more than 70 million people voted for the guy.
If you were expecting a"return to normalcy," you may be shocked.
Just a handful of Republican senators have congratulated Biden on his win, which is either evidence of pique within the party at having been defeated, or, more likely, evidence that Republican officeholders aren''t yet sure what kind of power Trump will continue to hold in the party once his time in actual power is over.
Of the Republican senators who congratulated Biden, one voted that Trump should be removed from office (Mitt Romney), while another voted Trump''s Supreme Court nominee (Susan Collins) and a third voted against him on Obamacare (Lisa Murkowski).
Bottom line: Trump''s not yet ready to move on from the White House. Republicans aren''t yet ready to move on from Trump.
Here''s what Michelle Obama said on Instagram: "Let''s remember that this is just a beginning. It''s a first step. Voting in one election isn''t a magic wand, and neither is winning one. Let''s remember that tens of millions of people voted for the status quo, even when it meant supporting lies, hate, chaos, and division. We''ve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us."
5 key segments of Trumpism -- The strains of Trump''s coalition are held together in part by the man himself, according to Jeff Goodwin, an NYU sociologist, who is quoted in a story by CNN''s Greg Krieg and Dan Merica.
Goodwin described Trumpism as a "contradictory, unstable amalgam" of five key ideological pieces:
Social Conservatism, as seen in Trump''s anti-abortion and anti-LGBT polices;
Neoliberal Capitalism, characterized by tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation;
Economic Nationalism, which is not inherently right-wing, but can be steered that way, as Trump has;
Nativism in the form of anti-immigrant rhetoric;
and White Nationalism, underscored by the President''s refusal to disavow racist groups like the Proud Boys.
Goodwin: "A large part of Trumpism''s appeal is Trump''s personal appeal to a lot of people -- as a celebrity, as a crass speaker of truth, as these people see him, someone who doesn''t mince words, someone who really tells it like it is. He''s figured things out, he''s a billionaire and he knows how the system works," Goodwin said. "All these elements of Trump''s personality and character seem to have a lot of appeal to a big segment of the population. But I don''t know if there is Trumpism without Trump."
Trump 2.0? Trump as a person has followers. But he''s a man, not a movement, which is important. This line from Krieg and Merica is key, for me: Whether there is a politician or celebrity outsider who can harness the fervor in the way Trump did, at least for a few years, is another open question. The President, even after he leaves office, will retain his Twitter account -- and with it, the potential to become a GOP kingmaker. Two of his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have already promised political retribution against Republicans who don''t promote their father''s lies about election fraud.', '2020-11-10 16:09:34');

Biden told his allies over the weekend that he wanted to give Republicans -- and President Donald Trump -- a little time to accept the results of the election.
But the Trump-appointed General Services Administration administrator, Emily W. Murphy, whose job is to declare that there is a president-elect -- a move that triggers the transition process -- has not yet made that declaration. And the GSA issued a statement Monday inaccurately comparing Biden''s win to the George W. Bush vs. Al Gore election of 2000, in which the outcome at this stage was in doubt.
The statement triggered worry in Biden''s camp that it is facing a fight to get federal agencies to accept the legitimacy of the outcome of the 2020 election.
Biden allies will start escalating their rhetoric on the matter, making the case for the election''s legitimacy in television interviews and more, the officials said.
In a call with reporters Monday night, Biden transition officials would not rule out legal action against the GSA to try to force the beginning of the transition process, and said they have a "number of options."
"We believe that it is clear that President-elect Biden and (Vice President-elect) Kamala Harris should be entitled to all GSA functions and all functions across government and we''re asking GSA administrator to make a proper ascertainment," one official said.
The Biden officials complained that they are missing the $6.3 million Congress has appropriated to support the transition process. They also said transition officials are not able to access federal agencies or their employees, and do not have secure access to obtain and discuss classified information.
Democrats on Capitol Hill are furious with the delay, too. In a letter to Murphy, three House Democrats -- Reps. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, Dina Titus of Nevada and Bill Pascrell of New Jersey -- requested a briefing and told Murphy she was "undermining the urgent need for a prompt and effective transition of power in the midst of a global pandemic that must be focused on the safety and well-being of our citizens."
To begin the transition process, Murphy needs to sign a letter to release funds to the Biden transition team through a process called ascertainment. This would mark the first formal acknowledgment from the Trump administration that Biden has in fact won the election, but it would also unlock access to national security tools to streamline background checks and additional funds to pay for training and incoming staff.
Yet more than 48 hours after the race was called by numerous news organizations, Murphy has not yet signed off. A GSA spokesperson declined to provide a specific timeline for when ascertainment would take place, a clear signal the agency won''t get ahead of the President, who has yet to admit he lost.
"An ascertainment has not yet been made," GSA spokesperson Pamela Pennington told CNN in a statement Monday afternoon.
"There are no updates at this time and GSA''s position remains the same. An ascertainment has not yet been made. GSA and its administrator will continue to abide by, and fulfill, all requirements under the law and adhere to prior precedent established by the Clinton Administration in 2000," Pennington added in an incorrect comparison to the 2000 election.
Pennington said in Sunday statement that the General Services Administration doesn''t pick who wins the election, but instead "ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution."
She declined to respond to CNN''s request for details on the threshold for an "apparent successful candidate."
A transition expert familiar with the GSA told CNN that it has "always been a quick decision" whether to ascertain a successful candidate.
In the 2016 Trump election, the source said, it was made by the Obama administration the day after. In 2008, it was made the night of the election, around 1 a.m. The only time it was ever delayed, the source said, was in 2000, when Florida went to a mandatory recount and ascertainment was made the day after the Supreme Court case was decided.
Yet President George W. Bush said in a statement Sunday that the November 3 election "was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear." And multiple Republican officials have issued statements calling Biden the "President-elect."
Biden transition officials rejected the comparison to 2000 on their call with reporters Monday night.
"This is not 2000 by any stretch. That involved one state that had a 500 vote-plus margin, that had a number of different lines of contention of ballots that would altered the outcome of that election and therefore the entire Electoral College vote," a Biden official said. "This is a very different situation," the official added, noting that all major news outlets have projected that Biden is the race''s winner.', '2020-11-09 16:11:15');

It strongly recommends increased testing in its weekly reports to states.

"There is continued, accelerating community spread across the top half of the country, where temperatures have cooled and Americans have moved indoors," reports dated November 8 and distributed to states Tuesday evening said.
The task force, which warned of "significant deterioration in the Sunbelt" in last week''s set of reports, said that that deterioration has only continued in the past week, "leading to the most diffuse spread experienced to date."
The weekly task force reports continue to provide an unvarnished, unfiltered look at the reality of each state''s current situation, which comes as President Donald Trump and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence have declined to address the worsening pandemic publicly in weeks. The White House has repeatedly declined to make all of the reports publicly accessible.
In recommendations to several states, the task force called for an expansion of testing, particularly to target asymptomatic cases.
"The silent community spread that precedes and continues throughout surges can only be identified and interrupted through proactive and increased testing and surveillance," reports for multiple states said, suggesting expanding point-of-care antigen tests.
The reports said: "Proactive testing must be part of the mitigation efforts, inclusive of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and immediate isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine."
A report for New Mexico, where the task force said there is "full and unrelenting community spread," noted that requiring testing only for individuals experiencing Covid-19 symptoms "is preventing adequate testing and control of the pandemic."
North Dakota remains the state with the highest number of new cases per 100,000 population, followed by South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, Illinois, Utah and Minnesota in the top 10.
Vermont remains the state with the lowest number of cases and is one of only two states, including Hawaii, in the task force-defined "yellow zone" for new cases, meaning between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 population. But Vermont was still warned in its report that there is "cause for concern given the continued uptick in the state" coinciding with colder weather.
Wisconsin, the White House task force said, is seeing a continued "unrelenting rise in cases and test positivity in an ongoing health emergency that is leading to increasing hospitalizations and deaths." The report called for "a more comprehensive mitigation strategy," including additional testing.
"The current situation is worsening dramatically," the Wisconsin report said, pressing the need for reinforced messaging around social gatherings and more asymptomatic surveillance.
In Iowa, the task force called the spread of coronavirus "unyielding ... with new hospital admissions, inpatients and patients in the ICU at record levels, indicating deeper spread across the state."
The task force called for "immediate action including mask requirements to decrease severity in morbidity and mortality among Iowans."
There is still not a statewide mask mandate in Iowa.
The report for Ohio described "vast and unmitigated community spread" with "no evidence of improvement."
In Delaware, where cases are disproportionately affecting young adults between 20 and 35 years of age, the task force said, "We share the assessment of Delaware leaders that the Covid epidemic is likely to worsen."
Some state reports reiterated the need for communication of "basic actions" residents should take.
"Do not gather without a mask with individuals living outside of your household," "Always wear a mask in public places," "Stop gatherings beyond immediate household until cases and test positivity are in the yellow zone" and "Get your flu shot," the reports warned.
And, as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, one state''s report stressed the need for indoor mask usage.
"We need to protect those we are thankful for in our families and communities. Ensure indoor masking around vulnerable family members during any gatherings due to the significant amount of virus circulating and the high rate of asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections among family and community members," the report said.', '2020-11-12 16:12:32');

News of his plan for the commission comes after the candidate has declined in recent weeks to answer whether he would expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court, a proposal that is commonly referred to as "court packing." Following the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, some progressive members of the Democratic Party have floated the idea of expanding the size of the court and adding liberal justices should Biden be elected and Democrats take the majority in the Senate.

"If elected what I will do is I''ll put together a national commission of -- bipartisan commission of -- scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative, and I will ask them to over 180 days come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it''s getting out of whack, the way in which it''s being handled," Biden said in a one-minute released clip from his "60 Minutes" interview with Norah O''Donnell.
"And it''s not about court packing. There''s a number of other things that constitutional scholars have debated and I''ve looked to see what recommendations that commission might make," he added.
Biden warned against the Supreme Court turning into a political football.
The full interview will air on CBS'' "60 Minutes" Sunday.
The former vice president gave his most direct answer on the issue last week when he signaled that he''s "not a fan" of court packing, and he promised last week during an ABC town hall that he will provide a clearer stance before the election.
"So you''ll come out with a clear position before election day?" ABC''s George Stephanopoulos asked.
Biden replied, "Yes. Depending on how they handle this," referring to Senate Republicans.
As he has avoided directly answering the question, Biden has taken to accusing President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans of court-packing, saying their push to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court before the election is an effort to undo the Affordable Care Act.
"Getting rid of Obamacare is why they are racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court," Biden said in remarks in Michigan last Friday. "Make no mistake about it, Trump has made it clear from the beginning ... he wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he''s made that incredibly clear as well."', '2020-11-22 16:13:33');
